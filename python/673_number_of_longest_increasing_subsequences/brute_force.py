This solution first determines the length of longest increasing subsequence by calculating
length using lis_tails which stores for each index, the invariant is 
lis_tails[j] where j<=i stores the smallest value that could be part of some longest 
increasing subsequence 
7 8 2 9 10 lets say is input then
lis_tails for i = 0 to 4 is as follows
i=0 -> [7]
i=1 -> [7,8] observe that 7 and 8 are smallest values of increasing subsequence till index i=1
i=2 -> [2,8] at this point we replace 7 with 2 eventhoug 2 is not part of a valid longest increasing
             subsequence, this allows us to improve upon the exisiting soln if a longest increasing 
             subsequence starts with 2 
             tails[0] will always store the smallest value observed till index i that can be part of 
             a increasing subsequence
             tails[1] will store the second smallest value and so on
i=3 -> [2,8,9]
i=4 -> [2,8,9,10]
so length is 4 lis_length = 4

In brute force approach we are trying to store all subseqences of length 1 to length lis_length
and counting total subsequences of lis_length

we created a 2d array dp which gives for length l what are possible subsequences untill index i
we are using a List[List[List[List[int]]]]
**Brute-Force DP Enumeration**: Once we know `lis_length`, we build a
    4D DP structure `dp[length][i]`:
      - **Dimensions**: `dp` is declared as `List[List[List[List[int]]]]`, i.e.,
        `dp[length][end_idx]` is itself a **list of lists of ints**.
      - **Outer list** at `dp[length][end_idx]` collects *all* distinct increasing
        subsequences of size `length` that end precisely at index `end_idx`.
      - **Inner lists** are each one subsequence (e.g. `[3, 5, 9]`, `[3, 8, 9]`, ...).
      - We iterate from `length=2` to `lis_length`, extending every subsequence in
        `dp[length-1][prev_idx]` (for `prev_idx < end_idx`) when its last value
        is < `nums[end_idx]`.

    This explicit storage of *every* subsequence is why memory/time blow up
    exponentially (â‰ˆ sum of binomial(n, k)), since `dp[length][i]` must accommodate
    zero, one, or many subsequence lists.


    # Example (n=6): nums = [3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5]
    # -----------------------------------------
    # dp[1]: subsequences of length 1 at each index

    #   dp[2][0] = []
    #   dp[2][1] = []

    #   dp[2][3] = [[3, 4], [1, 4], [2, 4]]
    #   dp[2][4] = [[3, 6], [1, 6], [2, 6], [4, 6]]
    #   dp[2][5] = [[3, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5], [4, 5]]
    #
    # dp[3]: subsequences of length 3
    #   dp[3][0] = []
    #   dp[3][1] = []
    #   dp[3][2] = []                  # too few elements before index 2
    #   dp[3][3] = [[1, 2, 4]]         # extending [1,2] at dp[2][2]
    #   dp[3][4] = [[1, 2, 6], [3, 4, 6], [1, 4, 6], [2, 4, 6]] # Using dp[2][2], dp[2][3]
    #   dp[3][5] = [[1, 2, 5], [3, 4, 5], [1, 4, 5], [2, 4, 5]] # using dp[2][2],dp[2][3],dp[2][4]
    #
    # dp[4]: subsequences of length 4
    #   dp[4][3] = []             
    #   dp[4][4] = [[1, 2, 4, 6]] # etc. depending on valid extensions
    #   dp[4][5] = [[1, 2, 4, 5]] # Using dp[3][3] and dp[3][4]
    #
    # Above, each dp[l][i] is a **list of lists**: the outer list groups multiple
    # subsequences, and each inner list is one full sequence.
So for each length we are iterating through length-1 index (minimum possible index that can have 
that length so length = 3 => index 2 to n 0,1,2 indexes can form a subsequence) 
So outer two loops take O(n**2)
# Build subsequences of length 2 to lis_length
    for length in range(2, lis_length + 1): O(n)
        for end_idx in range(length - 1, n): O(n)
            current_value = nums[end_idx]
